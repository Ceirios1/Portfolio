## PERSONAL STATEMENT
"Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn." – Steve Jobs. 
This one quote, is something that makes me want to be educated, and educate others through the uses of technology. If it wasn’t for the era I grew up in, I wouldn’t be as grateful for today’s technology as others are today. From the earliest moments off my life that I can remember, I was always amazed by computers. I vividly remember the joy I got from using my Dad’s PC for he first time at the age of 3 years old. Ever since that day I have been hooked. From Nintendo, Playstation, Xbox to PC’s, I have been gaming and enjoying the brilliance of today’s technology all of my life. An education in Computer Science was something I dreamt of from a young age. To be able to study a course that not only interested me, but I genuinely enjoyed was all I wanted. I am currently studying Computing and Game Devlopment in Lewes College.

It is very important to include your dates of employment regardless of whether you are still in the job you have listed. This is because Monster’s CV Search will use these dates as well as the skills obtained/utilised in this time period to determine if you’re what an employer is looking for.

### Responsibilities:
 
·         Provide key achievements within a role and try to highlight the skills used to obtain your goal
·         Try to avoid soft terms like “high energy” and aim for skills used within the role – such as “programming using C++”
·         Provide enough information to entice your potential employers to call you
·         Always keep examples relevant to the role you are applying for
·         Find out more about how to identify your achievements.

For older jobs you should keep the details slightly shorter, remembering to include your dates of employment and key skills obtained/applied to achieve your goals.
 
### Responsibilities:
 
·         Try to avoid cliché phrases that don’t differentiate you as a candidate
·         Always tailor your CV for each job application to match the requirements
·         Try not to waffle if you feel like you don’t have much to write in this area. Succinct to the point CVs will be preferred as they are quick to read and won’t be generic
 
 
### EDUCATION:
If you are looking for your first job and do not have much or any work experience at this point – do not fret. Expand on your education responsibilities and apply them to real life scenarios so an employer has an understanding of what you have achieved and the means used to get these achievements.
