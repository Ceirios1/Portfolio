## PERSONAL STATEMENT
"Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time." â€”Thomas A. Edison <br/>
A highly motivated, confident and dedicated individual who learns fast and think cratively. I am currently in my seacond year at Lewes College studing Softwere and Game desing. Having gained wide amounts of experience in the catering industry I have been able to equip myself with strong communication and interpersonal skills whilst using a proactive initiative to deliver a quality experience for the client in a constantly changing work environment. I am now looking to put these skills to use for a ski season.

 This job involves working in a team role meaning communication skills are crucial in order to work as an effective unit and deliver the best service to the clients. I believe this has really benefited by teamwork skills and pushed them to new heights. My ability to work under pressure has improved as I often deal with large crowds of guests demanding equal and immediate attention. I subsequently must perform tasks fast whilst under scrutiny to ensure everyone is satisfied and happy. This role has also taught me endurance as shifts can be long but professional customer relations must be maintained throughout. <br/>

  Working at a large hotel complex has enabled me to fully immerse myself in a strong team ethos. Becoming a part of a workforce made up of lots of different nationalities and subdivisions that must all work together to ensure the best results for the customers, whilst still enabling me to develop and build upon individual problem-solving skills that are required when dealing with constantly changing scenarios has been very rewarding.  <br/>

### PERSONAL INTERESTS:
- Skiing - Skiing has become one of my favourite past times and due to relatively frequent trips, I have been able to increase my skiing to a level that allows me to enjoy everything the mountain has to offer.
- Dungeons & Dragons - I started playing Dungeons & Dragons two years ago and have enjoyed all of it and am now a regular member of a club in Brighton. The game encourages teamwork and creative problem-solving. It has also helped with my public speaking as a large part of the game is just talking eg. arguing for or against a course of action.
- PC Gaming - Gaming is one of my favourite hobbies as there is such a broad range of game genres which test me in different ways. Some are about strategical thinking and planning for the future while others are about honing skills like reactions and quick thinking. Lastly, some are about relaxing and using my creativity.
