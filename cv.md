## PERSONAL STATEMENT
"Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn." – Steve Jobs. <br/> 
This one quote, is something that makes me want to be educated, and educate others through the uses of technology. If it wasn’t for the era I grew up in, I wouldn’t be as grateful for today’s technology as others are today. From the earliest moments off my life that I can remember, I was always amazed by computers. I vividly remember the joy I got from using my Dad’s PC for he first time at the age of 3 years old. Ever since that day I have been hooked. From Nintendo, Playstation, Xbox to PC’s, I have been gaming and enjoying the brilliance of today’s technology all of my life. An education in Computer Science was something I dreamt of from a young age. To be able to study a course that not only interested me, but I genuinely enjoyed was all I wanted. I am currently studying Computing and Game Devlopment in Lewes College.

 This job involves working in a team role meaning communication skills are crucial in order to work as an effective unit and deliver the best service to the clients. I believe this has really benefited by teamwork skills and pushed them to new heights. My ability to work under pressure has improved as I often deal with large crowds of guests demanding equal and immediate attention. I subsequently must perform tasks fast whilst under scrutiny to ensure everyone is satisfied and happy. This role has also taught me endurance as shifts can be long but professional customer relations must be maintained throughout. <br/>
